Experiment 1 analysis:
Player 1: MCTS vanilla w/ static tree size of 100 nodes
Player 2: MCTS vanilla w/ dynamic node tree sizes (100, 300, 500, 1000)

For smaller tree sizes (1-100 nodes), player 1 won a majority of the rounds. However, as the tree size began to increase,
player 2's win rate significantly grew. The upward trend of player 2's win rate continued until it plateaued around 500 
nodes, with no significant change to win rate as the tree size further increased (500 -> 1000 nodes only saw an increase of 2%).
