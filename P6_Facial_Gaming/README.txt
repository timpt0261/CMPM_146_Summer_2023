o How well did your interface work?
	The interface was intuitive with the guidance of the emotion reference. 
	However, there might be a few challenges in getting accurate facial expressions every time, 
	especially if the lighting conditions are not ideal.
o Did it recognize your facial expressions with the same accuracy as it achieved against the test set?
	The accuracy in a real-world setting might be slightly lower due to a variety of factors 
	like different lighting conditions, camera quality, slight variations in facial expressions, etc.
o If not, why not?
	The test set usually has a standard set of data with controlled variables, but in a live setting, 
	many factors can affect accuracy: ambient light, camera resolution, user's exact facial expression, and more.
